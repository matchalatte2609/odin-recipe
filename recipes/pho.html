  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pho got its start in northern Vietnam around the beginning of the twentieth century. The exact circumstances are unclear, but Vietnam’s signature noodle soup resulted from cultures rubbing shoulders. There are many theories about the original pho but one good explanation points to a glut of beef parts – bones, offal, and tough cuts leftover from French colonialists slaughtering cows for their tender steaks. Locals were enjoying a water buffalo-based rice vermicelli noodle soup.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Beef bones and tough beef cuts</li>
    <li>Flat rice noodles</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Charring onion and ginger slightly turns their harshness into sweetness</li>
    <li>After straining and chilling, the fat congeals and is removed</li>
    <li>Then the broth is reheated, bowls are assembled with noodles and thinly sliced steak, and the broth is ladled into the bowls to heat things through and cook off the raw beef. </li>
  </ol>
